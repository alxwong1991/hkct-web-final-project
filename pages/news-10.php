                    [New Features]<br><br><br>

                    Barbarian Clans Game Mode<br><br>
                    A new game mode that adds diverse Barbarian groups and strategies.
                    This game mode replaces standard Barbarian Tribes with Clans, with a variety of terrain and combat
                    preferences.
                    Additionally, the mode introduces new player actions for peaceful interactions with Barbarians that
                    provide increased strategic options.<br><br><br>
                    Every Clan can progress towards converting into a City-State.
                    If the camp remains in play long enough and/or receives enough boosts from player actions, it will
                    transform into a new City-State.<br><br><br>
                    New Clans Types<br><br>
                    This mode includes seven types of Barbarian Clans.
                    Each clan type has its own preferred range of units to field and requires a different set of map
                    conditions in order to appear.
                    In addition to their normal units, clans also have the ability to field Unique Units from Civs that
                    were not selected during game setup.
                    <ul class="list">
                      <li>Flatland Clan – Prefers to place their Outposts in open terrain away from woods and hills.
                        They prefer a balance of melee units for attack and ranged units for defense.</li>
                      <li>Woodland Clan – Prefers to place their Outposts in or adjacent to woods and rainforests.
                        They prefer greater numbers of ranged units than melee units and use them for both attack and
                        defense.</li>
                      <li> Hills Clan – Prefers to place their Outposts on open terrain with hills. They strongly prefer
                        melee units,
                        even to the point of excluding ranged units completely.</li>
                      <li> Rover Clan – Require a nearby Horse resource and prefer to place their Outposts in open
                        terrain away from woods.
                        They prefer as many mounted units as possible, using both light and heavy cavalry for attack and
                        defense.</li>
                      <li> Chariot Clan – Require a nearby Horse resource and prefer to place their Outposts in the
                        desert.
                        They prefer mounted vehicles and light cavalry in all roles, rarely using ranged units at all.
                      </li>
                      <li> Jungle Clan – Requires a nearby Ivory resource and prefer to place their Outposts inside
                        rainforests.
                        They prefer a mixture of light and heavy cavalry units supported by foot and ranged units.</li>
                      <li> Seafaring Clan – Always place their Outposts on coastal plots. They defend their Outposts
                        with land-based anti-cavalry units,
                        but otherwise they exclusively use naval melee and naval ranged units for scouting and
                        attacking.</li>
                    </ul>

                    New Unit Commands
                    <br><br>
                    Combat units that enter a Barbarian Outpost do not automatically destroy it. Instead, they can
                    choose from two new unit commands to deal with the clan.
                  </p>
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li> Disperse Clan – Destroy the clan completely and earn experience points for the dispersing unit.
                    </li>
                    <li> Raid Clan – Player is rewarded with Gold and the clan’s progress towards City-State conversion
                      is reduced, but the Outpost is not destroyed.
                      Raided clans gain immunity to raids for a short duration and spawn a defender unit in reprisal the
                      same turn. </li>
                  </ul>

                    New Player Commands<br><br>
                    Players can take peaceful or diplomatic actions with Clans. To initiate one of these interactions,
                    players will need to click on the map banner over the Outpost.
                  </p>
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li> Hire Clan – Spend Gold to permanently purchase the best military unit the clan can currently
                      train.
                      The clan will gain progress towards City-State conversion. </li>
                    <li> Ransom Unit from Clan – Spend Gold to recover a civilian unit captured by the clan.
                      Clans that ransom units lose progress towards City-State conversion. </li>
                    <li> Bribe Clan – Spend Gold to expel units from your territory and prevent them from targeting your
                      cities for a number of turns.
                      The clan will gain progress towards City-State conversion. </li>
                    <li> Incite Clan – Spend Gold to encourage the clan to raid and attack the cities of another
                      civilization.
                      The clan will lose progress towards City-State conversion.</li>

                  <p>
                    Leader Selection Pool</p>
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li>The Leader Selection Pool is a new advanced option that allows players to create 2 custom pools
                      of leaders for their single and multiplayer games.
                      What this does is allow players to create lists of leaders that can be chosen by others, or by the
                      AI.
                      For instance, you might want to have one group of leaders for your friends in an online game, and
                      then restrict the AI to a different set of leaders.
                      This still allows for some randomness - you could create a list of leaders that you haven't seen
                      before,
                      a list of non-aggressive leaders for a peaceful game, or all the warmongers for a real brawl.</li>
                  </ul>
                </span></div>

                        They prefer mounted vehicles and light cavalry in all roles, rarely using ranged units at all.
                      </li>
                      <li> Jungle Clan – Requires a nearby Ivory resource and prefer to place their Outposts inside
                        rainforests.
                        They prefer a mixture of light and heavy cavalry units supported by foot and ranged units.</li>
                      <li> Seafaring Clan – Always place their Outposts on coastal plots. They defend their Outposts
                        with land-based anti-cavalry units,
                        but otherwise they exclusively use naval melee and naval ranged units for scouting and
                        attacking.</li>

                    <br><br>
                    Combat units that enter a Barbarian Outpost do not automatically destroy it. Instead, they can
                    choose from two new unit commands to deal with the clan.

                  <ul class="list">
                    <li> Disperse Clan – Destroy the clan completely and earn experience points for the dispersing unit.

                    <li> Raid Clan – Player is rewarded with Gold and the clan’s progress towards City-State conversion
                      is reduced, but the Outpost is not destroyed.
                      Raided clans gain immunity to raids for a short duration and spawn a defender unit in reprisal the
                      same turn. </li>

                    players will need to click on the map banner over the Outpost.

                      The clan will gain progress towards City-State conversion. </li>

                      Clans that ransom units lose progress towards City-State conversion. </li>
                    <li> Bribe Clan – Spend Gold to expel units from your territory and prevent them from targeting your
                      cities for a number of turns.
                      The clan will gain progress towards City-State conversion. </li>
                    <li> Incite Clan – Spend Gold to encourage the clan to raid and attack the cities of another
                      civilization.
                      The clan will lose progress towards City-State conversion.</li>

                    Leader Selection Pool</p>
                  <ul class="list">
                    <li>The Leader Selection Pool is a new advanced option that allows players to create 2 custom pools
                      of leaders for their single and multiplayer games.
                      What this does is allow players to create lists of leaders that can be chosen by others, or by the
                      AI.
                      For instance, you might want to have one group of leaders for your friends in an online game, and
                      then restrict the AI to a different set of leaders.
                      This still allows for some randomness - you could create a list of leaders that you haven't seen
                      before,
                      a list of non-aggressive leaders for a peaceful game, or all the warmongers for a real brawl.</li>
