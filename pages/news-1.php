                    As many players have learned over the last 30 years,
                    Civilization is famous for the “one more turn” phenomenon
                    – where you sit down to play a quick game, and then
                    suddenly look up at your clock to discover it’s already 2
                    A.M. Over the years, people have asked why “One more Turn”
                    has such an impact on players. The game designer’s answer
                    here is that we give the player short-term goals,
                    medium-term goals, and long-term goals that are all
                    juggled at once in the player’s mind. You identify a place
                    to settle a city, then figure out what technology or
                    building or means of production you should pursue, and of
                    course you’d have a grand vision of how big your civ would
                    be or what type of victory condition you would try to
                    achieve. Civilization is designed to keep pushing you
                    forward – a new technology to discover, a new continent to
                    explore, and you always have things to do.

                    But good game design doesn’t necessarily explain how we
                    managed to reach 30 years of Civilization. To understand
                    this, I think we need to dive deeper. At its core, what do
                    players enjoy about Civilization? What differentiates the
                    Civ player? It could be a love of culture or history, but
                    there are other historical games out there. It could be
                    that players appreciate the careful game design, but there
                    are plenty of other well-designed games too.

                    path of humanity for the better. To have the grand vision
