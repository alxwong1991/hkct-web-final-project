                      Group 4 - In our final match of the day, we had Kupe go up against Trajan. Both leaders were neck and neck throughout the voting,

                    It’s almost time to THROW DOWN. The Civilization VI Leader Royale kicks off May 20 on Twitter and Civ fans have a front-row seat. 
                    No tourists, no tanks, just your favorite Civ leaders facing off in a history-making tournament. Only one can come out on top.<br><br>

                    Here’s how it works: We’ve recruited 32 of your favorite Civ VI leaders and set them up in a 4-round bracket. Each week, 
                    you’ll get a chance to vote for your favorite leader on Twitter. By the end, there can only be one still standing. <br>
                    The winner will take over our Twitter channel for a full month.
